# Analyzing-Insurance-Auto-Claims
Analyzed automobile insurance claims data to identify drivers of profitability and financial risk. The study examined customer behavior, policy types, locations, and claim history to uncover high-risk segments, improve pricing strategies, reduce losses, and support data-driven decisions for customer retention and long-term business stability.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes automobile insurance data to understand the factors that drive claim frequency, customer profitability, and financial risk. The goal is to help an insurance company improve pricing strategies, reduce losses, and retain high-value customers using data-driven insights.

## Business Problem
Insurance companies face challenges in identifying high-risk customers, unprofitable policy types, and geographic regions with excessive claim costs. Understanding these patterns is essential for balancing profitability while maintaining customer loyalty and long-term financial stability.

## Dataset & Scope
The analysis examines customer demographics, policy types, sales channels, geographic locations, premium amounts, customer lifetime value (CLV), and historical claim data to evaluate profitability and risk exposure.

## Methodology
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to identify trends and relationships between claims, premiums, policy types, and customer tenure. Segmentation and comparative analysis were used to evaluate claim behavior across different customer groups, locations, and policy categories.

## Key Insights
Corporate policies generated the highest customer lifetime value, while specialty policies underperformed.  
New customers were more likely to file claims early in their tenure.  
Claim frequency varied significantly by geographic location.  
Higher premiums often correlated with higher CLV, but did not always indicate lower risk.

## Recommendations
The analysis suggests implementing risk-based and location-based pricing, strengthening fraud detection mechanisms, revisiting underperforming policy pricing, and improving screening for new customers to reduce financial risk and improve profitability.
